          <p>The Tiwanaku (Tiahuanaco) Empire ruled from around 400 A.D. to 1200 A.D. before the earliest advanced
            civilizations in the New World, such as the Incas and Aztecs. The Empire expanded through a high-altitude
            mountain range
            called "El Altiplano" and controlled territory around Lake Titicaca.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <p>Throughout this whole area, unification and farming were just as important as religion. Early Tiahuanacos
            believed in
            multiple gods that controlled their environment and climate, including the Sun, Moon, and Rain Gods. With
            this heavy
            emphasis on astrology, they also had believed in animal deities that lived among them. The Puma and Snake
            are among the
            most important, symbolizing punishment and danger for those who did not respect the supreme leaders.</p>

          <p>The Altiplano is full of harsh living conditions at such a height, making it difficult to breathe, work,
            and conserve
            stamina. The climate was even rougher, with high temperatures during the day and frosts during the night.
            Droughts are
            not common either. However, the Tiwanaku Empire adapted to their surroundings quickly to provide a habitable
            space for 1
            million people. Their discovery of Coca leaves gave them more stamina to control their airflow and work
            speed. Innovative
            farming techniques around Lake Titicaca and their artificial bed planting allowed them to get consistent
            yields of crops.
            Early weaving also allowed the Tiahuanaco Empire to use wool from Alpacas and llamas to protect the cold.

          <p>Several reasons led to the downfall of the Tiahuanaco Empire. Drought and terrible weather prevented a
            plentiful harvest and could no longer
            support such a large population. Politically, the imperial state started to lose its power as a new leader
            could not be selected and accepted
            by all. The environment of the Altiplano was truly unsuitable for a nation to thrive. Artifacts and pottery
            still being found today are being
            tested to see the exact time when the empire declined.</p>

        <p>The primary deity of the Tiwanaku culture is the "Dios de Los Baculos" (God of Staves). History describes
          this god as a blessing from Lake Titicaca,
          which rose from the water to create light. Several civilizations after the Tiahuancos have also worshiped this
          god, including the Incas, revealing its influence in this region.
          While not heavily believed in today because of Spanish
          conquistadors forcing Christianity upon the New World, the Dios de Los Baculos plays a part in defining
          authentic Tihuanacota culture. As a god that
          created everything in the unreachable sky, its relevance is great, so great that it is the centerpiece of "La
          Puerta del Sol." This is
          why so many souvenirs and textiles are based on the Dios de Los Baculos, as it has become a symbol and
          representation of the town itself.</p>

          provide safety through the freezing
          temperatures for the people and farmland. Offerings include llama bait, incense, sugar, coca leaves, etc. Even
          with all of this, the Tiwanaku descendants
          offer the "sullu", a cremated llama fetus. Aymaras, Bolivians, and tourists from the western world all come to
          watch the ritual. Evo Morales, previous

        <p>Ceramics were commonly made during the Tiahuanaco Empire. These were representations of gods, deities, and
          the human condition. Common figures include pumas, snakes, skulls, and gods. These well-painted and
          structured relics were part of the ritual and ceremony use for sacrifices and prayer. Tiahuanaco pottery
          defined the religious and spiritual life of the empire,
          which gives historians evidence of how they lived. Modern-day Tiwanaku adapted this style in their town
          through building design, souvenirs, and formal
          china. Currently, ceramics and artifacts are being found today throughout the ruins and Lake Titicaca. So far,
          archaeologists have found 2,500 ceramic vessels related
          to the Tiahuanaco culture in the lake. The past is still being rebuilt in Tiwanaku...</p>

      <div class="col-6 text-center">
        <p>UNESCO's presence in Tiwanaku has proved most beneficial, contributing to the growing tourism. In 2000, it
          declared Tiwanaku as "Centro Espiritual Y Politico de la Cultura Tiwanaku," meaning a center carrying values
          of the imperial state of the Tiahuanaco people.
          With help from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, Tiwanaku is currently protected by UNESCO specifically as
          a "sensational tourist experience for foreigners" and a site for present-day archeological studies, as stated
          on a tablet right outside the ruins. While UNESCO placed Tiwanaku on the map for
          tourism, its focus on the ruins draws it away from other parts of its culture not touched upon and the town
          itself. Western organizations such as UNESCO must better represent Tiwanaku instead of labeling it as a
          "sensational tourist experience," where
          the people, ceramics, and historical significances are forgotten. Local anthropologists and archeologists in
          Bolivia are currently making conclusions about the mysteries of the Tiahuanaco ruins and culture, while UNESCO
          only documents their own research and political
          circumstances. In their few articles on Tiwanaku, their most important information has to do with President
          Evo Morales's inauguration in Tiwanaku and their drone topological studies. More must be said about Tiwanaku
          for the western audience to grasp the
          culture and amount of local research (with constantly new findings) in this town.</p>

        <p style="font-size:24px"> While a bit far from the central town of Tiwanaku, Sank'a Uta is definitely worth the
          visit for its historical significance and recent discovery. Sank'a Uta is known as a "chullpa", a funeral
          tower where a noble from the Tiahuanaco
          and Aymara empires were born. These small castles were built like houses with gigantic rock slabs in a
          circular shape enough for a body. However, researchers have concluded that Sank'a Uta was not actually a
          burial site but a punishment
          dungeon. Historically, leaders of the empires would place subjects in this ruin if they did not pay respects
          to the gods/deities or the chiefs themselves. Their prisoners would be left there in the cold without food or
          water, leaving
          them with a bad name if they made it out alive. Did I also mention that Sank'a Uta means "burning of the
          soul"? It quite literally did this. Sank'a Uta overall shows the vitality of Tiwanaku's ancient ruins engaging
          in contemporary
          research of fascinating background.</p>

          supposed to resemble heaven, hell, and reality. Akapana Pyramid only has three of its initial seven steps due
          to conquistador destruction and current excavations. On top, one can get a view of
          Tiwanaku and the rest of the ruins, similar to how Tiahuanaco priests would view the astronomical signs in the
          sky. The Semisubterraneo Temple is seen as hell with all the carved out faces
          on the walls and pit-like structure. The style is unique in how the 25x25m divot is centered with the Dios de
          Los Baculos. 175 faces surround the center, which depicts the different ethnicities in the Tiahuanaco Empire.
          Kalasasaya Temple represents reality with a simple plaza look. An arched door outlines the
          "Monolito Ponce" as well as resembling the first equinox rays that entered perpeniculary when the land was
          first found. Overall, the architecture is advanced for the empire's period, setting it apart from other past

        <p style="font-size:24px">Outside Kalasasaya Temple lies Monolito Ponce. At 3.5 meters tall and 6 tons big, the
          statue wears a ceremonial mask holding two objects: the representation of religious power and political
          power. On its right shoulder is a carving of a Christian cross by the Spanish Conquistadors. They actually
          tried to exorcise all the monoliths with the intention of converting all of the people to Christianity. This
          cultural difference is worth seeing to really see how tall Mr. Ponce is.</p>

        <p style="font-size:24px">The Puerta del Sol is one of the most famous ruins here in Tiwanaku, and for a good
          reason. Made out of one stone slab, the Puerta del Sol places the Dios de Los Baculos as the centerpiece of
          the
          gate. There are carvings of human messengers and soldiers helping and protecting the god. Once again, the
          masonry is impressive, especially with the detailed figures on top of the door. Even though the Puerta del Sol
          is popular
          among tourists, other places and activities must not be overlooked.</p>

        <p style="font-size:24px">Off to the side, Puma Punku is a whole other area of ruins scattered around. Most of
          these ruins are H-shaped andesite rocks that historians and scientists had trouble discovering how they were
          placed. Recently, scientists found out that the stones were actually artificially made rather than brought
          from the mountains. Technology and knowledge were truly advanced to make Tiahuanaco "cement" from red stone,
          volcanic leftovers, clay, and organic acids
          . It is fascinating to see these cement blocks perfectly shaped with 90-degree edges and flawless hole
          openings.</p>

      <div class="col-6 text-center">



        <p style="font-size:24px">While it might seem obvious to visit the town plaza, many tourists do not do so. A
          stroll through the plaza would be not only calming but also interesting as one will get to see the influences
          of the Tiahuanaco Empire on
          the town. For example, the Catholic Church on the plaza is made out of rock from the Akapana Pyramid. Getting
          to interact with the locals, grabbing local food to eat, or buying souvenirs to take home are just a few more
          reasons
          to see the plaza. It is worth it to stay at a hotel for a couple of days to get the whole experience that
          Tiwanaku has to offer, starting by being around the Aymara locals and some of the most sacred ruins in the
          world.</p>
